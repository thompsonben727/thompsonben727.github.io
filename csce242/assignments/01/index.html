        When most people think of bowling, they think of it as a fun, casual hobby and not as a sport. They would
        be surprised to find out just how much there is to bowling, not just throwing the ball down the lane and hoping
        to hit as many pins as they can. Where the sport may not be as physically taxing as other sports like basketball
        or football, it still has just as much engagement and competition. Below is a link that goes into much more of the 
        things that make bowling a sport.

        One of the major differences when bowling casually versus professionally is how the lane behaves. To make it more
        challenging, different patterns of oil are laid on the lane by a machine that makes the ball behave in many ways
        based on how you throw it. Generally, it only applies if you curve the ball when throwing it, which is why it isn't 
        very important for a casual bowler to worry about the oil since most throw it straight. There are a lot of different 
        patterns that are used in different leagues, tournaments, and other types of competitive play.
